      <h2>Hello, I'm Grace!</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate travel and photography enthusiast who loves capturing moments from around the world.
        Photography has always been a way for me to tell stories — from quiet city streets to breathtaking landscapes.

      <p>
        This website is a collection of my favorite photographs from my travels.
        Through my lens, I hope to share not only beautiful views but also the emotions and memories that come with them.

      <h2>My Photography Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I first picked up a camera when I started traveling during college, and it quickly became my favorite companion.
        I'm drawn to natural lighting, candid moments, and exploring the connection between people and places.
